# Installation

Now that you know what PHION is, we can continue to installing this utility on our Linux machines. You can either install the command line tool for PHION (Python) or the GUI Application (QtQuick).

Although, none of the applications are in development right now, installation should as straightforward as installing any other application for most distros.

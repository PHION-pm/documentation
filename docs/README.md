# What is PHION

The PHION project is a package manager specifically for creating, installing and sharing rice packages. As much as I tried searching, I was unable to find such a solution for tiling window managers. There are sites like Gnome Look and KDE store but as far as we know, nothing for tiling window managers which most ricers tend to use.

> In case you are unfamiliar with term "ricing", it means to express the practice of customizing, souping-up, or making a *nix (Linux) desktop or installation more interesting. To learn more, we highly recommend checking out [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) to see ricing in action.
